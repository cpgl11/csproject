# QuizQuest
QuizQuest is an interactive trivia game where players can test their knowledge across various categories like history, science, and pop culture. With engaging questions and a timer, users can compete for the highest score while tracking their progress on the leaderboard. Playing on QuizQuest is a fun way to challenge one's mind, with the option to play solo or compete with others.

## Outline

← `Homepage`: The homepage introduce users to the website. It features an overview of the game, and its categories. It contains the header, the introduction section, the category buttons, the navigation bar, and the footer.

← `Game Page`: This page serves as the main gaming area where users participate in the quizzes from the different categories. The game will present questions with multiple-choice options, and users can track their scores while playing under a timer.

← `Leaderboard Page`: The leaderboard page shows a list of the highest scores from all users who played the game. Users can compare their performance with others and see their rank based on the number of correct answers and time spent.


## JS Implementation
The Game Page will be the central webpage where Javascript will be heavily utilized to handle user interaction, display questions, check answers, and update the page without reloading. Javascript will be implemented by retrieving the category from the homepage, loading and displaying the questions, setting up and displaying the timer, implementing and displaying the score, checking the answer, navigating between questions, and ending the game. I will use functions to implement all of these.
